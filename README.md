# Neural Network

Complete from-scratch implementation of neural networks (in ≈400-500 lines of code) with examples
for training on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and CIFAR-10 object recognition dataset.

Based off Y8 me’s overcomplicated (and likely
inaccurate) [code](https://github.com/JC-ProgJava/Building-Neural-Networks-From-Scratch) — reference code can be found
in subfolders `Backpropagation` and `Optimizers`.
